## Week 1

### 1. **Introduction to Operating System (OS)**

- **Definition**

  - An **Operating System (OS)** is a system software that manages hardware and software resources of a computer system and provides services for computer programs.
  - It acts as an **intermediary** between the **user** and **hardware**.

- **Why We Study OS**

  - To understand **resource management** (CPU, memory, I/O devices).
  - To learn **process synchronization**, **scheduling**, and **deadlock handling**.
  - To explore **modern OS concepts** like **distributed computing**, **virtualization**, and **cloud systems**.

- **Major Areas in OS**

  - **Process Management** â†’ Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
  - **Memory Management** â†’ Allocates and tracks system memory to ensure efficient usage.
  - **File System Management** â†’ Organizes data into files and directories for easy access.
  - **I/O System Management** â†’ Manages input/output operations and device communication.
  - **Security and Protection** â†’ Protects data, resources, and users from unauthorized access.
  - **Networking and Communication** â†’ Enables data exchange between systems via network protocols.

- **OS Manages**
  - **CPU** â†’ Execution, Scheduling, ALU operations, Process Control.
  - **Memory** â†’ Allocation, Paging, Segmentation, Virtual Memory.
  - **I/O Devices** â†’ Disk, Keyboard, Mouse, Printers, Network Interfaces.
  - **Files** â†’ Access control, Storage organization, File systems.

  - **Thread** â†’ A lightweight process within a process.
  - **Scheduling** â†’ Deciding which process runs next.
  - **Deadlock** â†’ Situation where processes wait indefinitely for resources.
  - **Paging** â†’ Memory management scheme eliminating contiguous allocation.

- **OS Concepts**

  - **Virtualization** â†’ Creates virtual versions of hardware or OS to run multiple systems on one machine.
  - **Synchronization** â†’ Ensures proper timing and coordination among concurrent processes.
  - **System Calls** â†’ Interface allowing user applications to request OS services.
  - **Protection and Security** â†’ Safeguards resources and maintains system integrity against threats.
  - **Concurrency Control** â†’ Manages simultaneous execution to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.

### 3. **Computer System Organization**

- **Components**
  - **Hardware** â†’ CPU, Memory, I/O Devices.
  - **Operating System** â†’ Controls and coordinates hardware usage.
  - **Application Programs** â†’ Compilers, Databases, Games, etc.
  - **Users** â†’ Humans, other systems, or automated scripts.
